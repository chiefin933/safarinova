# SafariNova Travels — Design Brainstorm

## Approach 1: "Obsidian Savanna"
<response>
<text>
**Design Movement:** Dark Luxury Editorial — inspired by high-end travel magazines like Condé Nast Traveller, combined with African earth-tone warmth.

**Core Principles:**
- Deep obsidian backgrounds with warm amber/terracotta accents
- Editorial-style typography with strong vertical rhythm
- Cinematic imagery — full-bleed, dramatic, immersive
- Sparse but intentional UI — every element earns its place

**Color Philosophy:**
- Background: near-black `#0D0D0D` / `#111111`
- Primary accent: warm amber `#D4A853` (gold of the savanna at dusk)
- Secondary: terracotta `#C4622D`
- Text: off-white `#F5F0E8` (warm, not clinical)
- Emotional intent: wealth, mystery, adventure, exclusivity

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Asymmetric editorial grid — text and images offset, never perfectly centered
- Full-bleed hero with overlaid typographic hierarchy
- Horizontal scroll for destination cards on desktop
- Sticky side-navigation for destination detail pages

**Signature Elements:**
- Thin gold rule lines as section dividers
- Circular destination thumbnails with gold border halos
- Subtle grain/noise texture overlay on hero sections

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Slow, cinematic hover transitions (400ms ease-out)
- Image parallax on scroll
- Cursor-following spotlight effect on hero

**Animation:**
- Hero text: staggered fade-up entrance (each word delayed 80ms)
- Cards: scale from 0.96 to 1.0 on hover with shadow bloom
- Page transitions: horizontal slide with opacity fade

**Typography System:**
- Display: Playfair Display (serif, editorial weight)
- Body: DM Sans (clean, modern, legible)
- Accent labels: Space Mono (monospace, for tags/categories)

- Muted: warm sand `#E8DFD0`
- Emotional intent: natural luxury, calm confidence, wanderlust

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Left-anchored hero with large typographic statement and right-side image panel
- Masonry-style destination grid (not uniform cards)
- Sticky top navigation that transitions from transparent to frosted-glass on scroll
- Full-width image sections alternating with contained text sections

**Signature Elements:**
- Organic blob/wave SVG dividers between sections
- Thin copper underlines on headings
- Destination cards with diagonal image crop and overlaid text

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Warm, unhurried transitions (300ms ease)
- Cards lift with soft shadow on hover
- Navigation items underline from left on hover

**Animation:**
